# junior-developer-group
[NEW: A brand new website HQ for our team](https://junior-developer-group.github.io/junior-developer-group/)

This repository is used for both, our new team page and team dashboard.

# TEAM MEMBERS -- INSTRUCTIONS 

## How to get started for the first time:
- Fork the repository (this will save a particular repo to your own profile)
- Clone the repository (this will download that particular repo to your computer and you'll have to pick where to 'save' it all)
- Open the repository folder in Visual Studio Code (or an IDE of your choice)

    #### Before you start working for the first time:
    - create a new branch and name it after your Jira ticket number and ticket title <br>
    ``` git checkout -b 'DEV-XXX-ticket-title'``` <br>
    - start writing your code and once you're ready commit your changes and push to 'dev' branch <br>
    ```git push origin 'dev'``` <br>

    PLEASE NOTE: We use 'dev' branch as our 'staging enviroment'. Our 'main' branch is reserved and we don't pull/push there. 

## How to get started (if it's not your first time):
- You'll have to change from your previous branch back into our 'dev' branch (git checkout 'dev')
- After you changed back to 'dev' branch, you'll have to get all updates that branch had since last time you visited <br>
``` git pull origin 'dev' ```<br>
- Now when you've got your 'dev' branch updated, you can go ahead and create yourself a new branch <br>
```git checkout -b 'DEV-XXX-ticket-title' ```<br>
- Once you're done writing your changes, you'll have to commit and push your changes to 'dev' branch <br>
``` git push origin 'dev' ```<br>

    PLEASE NOTE: We use 'dev' branch as our 'staging enviroment'. Our 'main' branch is reserved and we don't pull/push there.
